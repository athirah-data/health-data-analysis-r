# health-data-analysis-r

This repository demonstrates basic health data analysis workflows using R, with a focus on reproducible and interpretable analyses commonly used in public health and clinical research.

Tools & packages used:
- R
- tidyverse
- dplyr – data cleaning, transformation, and summarisation
- ggplot2 – basic data visualisation
- psych - reliability analysis
- stats - inferential analyses

Analyses Included
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Descriptive statistics
- Reliability testing (e.g, Cronbach's alpha)
- Prevalence estimation
- Chi-square tests
- Logistic regressions

Data visualization (gglplot2)
- gglot2 is used for basic visualisations to support data interpretation, such
  as:
  - Bar charts of prevalence by group
  - Simple comparisons between categorical variables
- This visualisations focus on clarity and communication rather than advanced
    customization

Note: All data used are simulated or anonymized for learning and demonstration purposes. Analyses demonstrated include reliability testing, prevalence estimation, chi-square tests, and logistic regression.
